Cameron Johnson had always loved snooty Plymouth with its adorable
, average arches. It was a place where he felt anxious.

He was a splendid, gracious, squash drinker with chubby arms and brunette toes. His friends saw him as a foolish, filthy friend. Once, he had even revived a dying, injured bird
. That's the sort of man he was.
he was a great guy loved playing basket ball played for his school loves chineese food  a big fan of the beatles in his free time plays a lot of xbox and other video games great guy to hang out with do meet him if you get a chance

Cameron was walking home from his classes one day when he ran into his "friends". They began to jeer and taunt him as he walked by, but he kept his head high and strode ahead, paying them no mind. Then he saw the arches. Cameron's knees buckled, and his eyes opened wide. The gang of teens behind him began to cackle. But, for the first time, he didn't break down in tears. Instead, he continued on his way, unfazed by the adorable, average arches. He was a new man.
