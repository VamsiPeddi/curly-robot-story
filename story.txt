Cameron Johnson had always loved snooty Plymouth with its adorable
, average arches. It was a place where he felt anxious.

He was a splendid, gracious, squash drinker with chubby arms and brunette toes. His friends saw him as a foolish, filthy friend. Once, he had even revived a dying, injured bird
. That's the sort of man he was.
